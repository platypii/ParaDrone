# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that

# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure that

# The default value is: NO.

# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the style sheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, see
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = 255

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use grayscales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 100

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.
# Minimum value: 40, maximum value: 240, default value: 80.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA  = 80

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the
# page has loaded.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = NO

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# Enable the USE_MATHJAX option to render LaTeX formulas using MathJax (see
# http://www.mathjax.org) which uses client side Javascript for the rendering
# instead of using pre-rendered bitmaps. Use this if you do not have LaTeX
# installed or if you want to formulas look prettier in the HTML output. When
# enabled you may also need to install MathJax separately and configure the path
# to it using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

USE_MATHJAX            = NO

# When MathJax is enabled you can set the default output format to be used for
# the MathJax output. See the MathJax site (see:
# http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/output.html) for more details.
# Possible values are: HTML-CSS (which is slower, but has the best
# compatibility), NativeMML (i.e. MathML) and SVG.
# The default value is: HTML-CSS.
# This tag requires that the tag USE_MATHJAX is set to YES.

# The DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT tag can be used to set the image format of the images
# generated by dot. For an explanation of the image formats see the section
# output formats in the documentation of the dot tool (Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/)).
# Possible values are: png, png:cairo, png:cairo:cairo, png:cairo:gd, png:gd,

# gif:cairo:gd, gif:gd, gif:gd:gd, svg, png:gd, png:gd:gd, png:cairo,
# png:cairo:gd, png:cairo:cairo, png:cairo:gdiplus, png:gdiplus and

# The default value is: png.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
