# ParaDrone Hardware Plans

Files for 3D printing ParaDrone parts.

3D models are generated programmatically in [JSCAD](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org) using javascript.
Generate an STL file by running `npx jscad autopilot.js`.

Models include:

 - Actuator: case for the toggle actuator around the spool
 - Autopilot: case for the paradrone autopilot microcontroller
 - Battery: case to secure the battery holder to the board
 - Remote control: case for the remote control LoRa relay
 - Spool: 3d printable spool for the toggle actuator
